## Introduction

High employee attrition can have significant impacts on an organization, including increased recruitment costs and loss of valuable talent. This project aims to analyze employee attrition data and develop a strategic retention plan by identifying key factors contributing to attrition.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

2. Install the required dependencies by running:

3. Explore the Jupyter Notebook files and Python scripts to understand the analysis and strategic retention planning.

## Data

The project uses an employee attrition dataset as the primary data source. Ensure that you have the dataset available in the appropriate location for the code to access.

## Analysis

The analysis phase includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and identify patterns and trends. Key factors contributing to employee attrition will be determined, including:

- Monthly Income: Analyze if the company's wages are competitive with industry benchmarks.
- Over Time: Explore the relationship between working overtime and attrition.
- YearsWithCurrManager: Analyze the timing of attrition concerning managers and take action based on:
- Number of employees under managers with high turnover rates.
- The duration a Line Manager has been in a position.
- Patterns in employee resignations.
- Age: Understand the correlation between employee age and attrition.
- DistanceFromHome: Examine the relationship between home location and attrition.
- TotalWorkingYears: Assess the attrition risk for employees with various years of experience.
- YearsAtCompany: Identify high-risk periods, such as employees reaching their two-year anniversary.

## Strategic Retention Plan

Based on the analysis, create a strategic retention plan that includes actions to address the identified attrition factors:

- Monthly Income: Implement wage adjustments to remain competitive.
- Over Time: Improve project scoping to reduce overtime.
- YearsWithCurrManager: Take various actions based on metrics, such as revisiting the organization's structure, offering management training, and identifying recurring patterns in resignations.
- Age: Clearly communicate the long-term vision of the company and opportunities for young employees.
- DistanceFromHome: Provide support through company transportation or transportation allowances.
- TotalWorkingYears: Identify employees with 5-8 years of experience as potentially high-risk and implement retention strategies.
- YearsAtCompany: Pay special attention to employees approaching their two-year anniversary and implement measures to retain them.

## Visualization

The project includes data visualizations to support the analysis findings. Visualizations may include bar charts, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
